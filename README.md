MVNU Moodle Enhanced&reg;
===========================
Making your MVNU Moodle experience ***that*** much better.
<br/><br/>
Features
--------
MVNU Moodle Enhanced&reg; provides a number of quality-of-life features that are intended to improve your overall Moodle experience. These features are designed with simplicity and student convenience in mind, with options such as Dark Mode, an expanded editor suite, and more.

### Dark Mode
The flagship addition of Enhanced is Dark Mode, a custom Moodle style option that is easier on the eyes (especially at night!) and provides a more modern take on the classic web interface.

Dark Mode can be activated by clicking the **Moon / Lightbulb** icon in the top right of the Moodle navigation bar.

Dark Mode also comes with various personalization settings for you to choose from. You can access these settings by right-clicking on the Dark Mode icon:

- **Toggle White Text** - Causes all manually styled text to be overriden with a variant of white (azure). This could make it easier to view text content on certain pages. *Can be toggled on and off.*
- 
- **Invert Color Scheme** - Disables the managed dark style, instead opting to invert the color scheme of the page. This feature is in development and is quite buggy — use at your own preference.
- 
- **Toggle Modern Font** - Replaces the primary font with a more modern, rounded font (Poppins).


### Miscellaneous
Enhanced brings several miscellaneous features to Moodle as well, such as toast notifications.
